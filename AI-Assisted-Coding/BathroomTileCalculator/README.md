Bathroom Tile Calculator

Simple client-side web app to calculate floor and wall tiles required for a rectangular bathroom and visualize the floor + four walls.

Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click or serve via a local static server).
2. Enter room dimensions in meters, tile sizes in centimeters, and door size in meters.
3. Click Calculate to see results and a simple blueprint visualization.

Assumptions

- Room is rectangular; walls are vertical with height applied equally to all four walls.
- Door is subtracted from total wall area and is placed on Wall A for visualization only.
- Tiles are rectangular; counts are rounded up to the next whole tile. No extra waste percentage is included.

Future improvements

- Add waste percentage option.
- Support windows and multiple openings on different walls.
- Better handling of tile cuts and orientation.
